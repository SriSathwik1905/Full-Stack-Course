## 4. Core Feature-wise Implementation

### **Feature 1: Playlist Engine (Doubly Linked List)**

**Scenario Brief:**
Real-world playlist management requires dynamic insertion, deletion, and reordering of songs. Users need to add songs anywhere in the playlist, remove tracks, and rearrange song order efficiently without recreating the entire playlist.

**Data Structures Used:**
- Doubly Linked List with SongNode containing bidirectional pointers
- Head and tail pointers for O(1) beginning/end operations

**Time and Space Complexity:**
- `add_song()`: O(1) - Direct tail insertion
- `delete_song()`: O(n) - Linear search + O(1) deletion
- `move_song()`: O(n) - Extract + insert operations
- `reverse_playlist()`: O(n) - Single pass pointer manipulation
- Space: O(n) where n = number of songs

**Sample Input & Output:**
```python
# Input
playlist.add_song("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", 355)
playlist.add_song("Hotel California", "Eagles", 391)
playlist.move_song(1, 0)  # Move Hotel California to position 0

# Output
=== My Playlist (2 songs) ===
0. Hotel California by Eagles (6:31)
1. Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen (5:55)
```

**Code Snippet:**
```python
def add_song(self, title: str, artist: str, duration: int) -> str:
    new_song = SongNode(title, artist, duration)
    if not self.head:
        self.head = self.tail = new_song
    else:
        self.tail.next = new_song
        new_song.prev = self.tail
        self.tail = new_song
    self.size += 1
    return new_song.song_id
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them:**
- **Challenge:** Maintaining bidirectional links during complex move operations
- **Solution:** Implemented careful pointer manipulation with edge case handling for head/tail updates
- **Challenge:** Memory efficiency for large playlists
- **Solution:** Used references instead of copying objects, implemented bounded history stack

---

### **Feature 2: Playback History (Stack)**

**Scenario Brief:**
Music apps need "undo" functionality for accidental song plays or user mistakes. A stack naturally implements LIFO behavior where the most recent action can be undone first.

**Data Structures Used:**
- Python list acting as stack with LIFO operations
- Bounded stack with max_size to prevent memory overflow

**Time and Space Complexity:**
- `push()`: O(1) - Append to list end
- `pop()`: O(1) - Remove from list end  
- `undo_last_play()`: O(1) - Stack pop + playlist add
- Space: O(k) where k = max_size (bounded at 50)

**Sample Input & Output:**
```python
# Input
history.push(song1)  # Play song1
history.push(song2)  # Play song2
history.undo_last_play(playlist)  # Undo last play

# Output
✓ Successfully undid last play - song re-added to playlist
History size: 1 songs
```

**Code Snippet:**
```python
def push(self, song: SongNode):
    if len(self.stack) >= self.max_size:
        self.stack.pop(0)  # Remove oldest
    self.stack.append({
        'song': song,
        'played_at': datetime.now()
    })
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them:**
- **Challenge:** Preventing infinite memory growth with unlimited history
- **Solution:** Implemented circular buffer behavior with max_size limit
- **Challenge:** Integrating undo with playlist state consistency
- **Solution:** Synchronized operations between history and playlist modules

---

### **Feature 3: Song Rating Tree (BST)**

**Scenario Brief:**
Users rate songs 1-5 stars for personalized recommendations. A BST organizes songs by rating for fast queries like "show all 5-star songs" or rating distribution analytics.

**Data Structures Used:**
- Binary Search Tree with rating-based organization
- Each node contains a rating (1-5) and list of songs with that rating

**Time and Space Complexity:**
- `insert_song()`: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case
- `search_by_rating()`: O(log n) tree traversal + O(k) result listing
- `get_rating_distribution()`: O(n) - visit all nodes
- Space: O(r + s) where r = unique ratings (≤5), s = total songs

**Sample Input & Output:**
```python
# Input
rating_tree.insert_song(song1, 5)  # 5-star rating
rating_tree.insert_song(song2, 4)  # 4-star rating
five_star_songs = rating_tree.search_by_rating(5)

# Output
Rating Distribution:
★★★★★: 2 songs
★★★★☆: 2 songs
★★★☆☆: 0 songs
```

**Code Snippet:**
```python
def insert_song(self, song: SongNode, rating: int) -> bool:
    if not (1 <= rating <= 5):
        return False
    if not self.root:
        self.root = RatingTreeNode(rating)
        self.root.add_song(song)
    else:
        rating_node = self._find_rating_node(self.root, rating)
        if not rating_node:
            self.root = self._insert_rating(self.root, rating)
            rating_node = self._find_rating_node(self.root, rating)
        rating_node.add_song(song)
    return True
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them:**
- **Challenge:** Handling multiple songs per rating efficiently
- **Solution:** Used lists within nodes to group songs by rating
- **Challenge:** Maintaining BST balance for optimal performance
- **Solution:** Documented worst-case scenarios and potential AVL tree upgrade path

---

### **Feature 4: Instant Song Lookup (HashMap)**

**Scenario Brief:**
Modern music apps need instant search across millions of songs. Users search by song title, artist name, or unique ID, requiring sub-second response times.

**Data Structures Used:**
- Three separate hash tables: ID→Song, Title→Songs, Artist→Songs
- defaultdict(list) for handling multiple songs per title/artist

**Time and Space Complexity:**
- `add_song()`: O(1) average - three hash insertions
- `get_song_by_id()`: O(1) average - direct hash lookup
- `search()`: O(1) average per table + O(m) result processing
- Space: O(3n) - three hash tables storing references

**Sample Input & Output:**
```python
# Input
lookup.add_song(song)
results = lookup.search("Queen")

# Output
Search 'Queen': 1 results found
  → Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen
```

**Code Snippet:**
```python
def search(self, query: str) -> List[SongNode]:
    query = query.lower()
    results = []
    
    # Search in titles (partial matching)
    for title, songs in self.title_to_songs.items():
        if query in title:
            results.extend(songs)
            
    # Search in artists (partial matching)
    for artist, songs in self.artist_to_songs.items():
        if query in artist:
            results.extend(songs)
    
    # Remove duplicates while preserving order
    seen = set()
    unique_results = []
    for song in results:
        if song.song_id not in seen:
            seen.add(song.song_id)
            unique_results.append(song)
    return unique_results
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them:**
- **Challenge:** Handling partial string matching efficiently
- **Solution:** Implemented contains-based search with case-insensitive comparison
- **Challenge:** Avoiding duplicate results from multiple table searches
- **Solution:** Used set-based deduplication while preserving result order

---

### **Feature 5: Time-based Sorting (Merge/Quick Sort)**

**Scenario Brief:**
Users want to sort large playlists by different criteria (title, duration, date added). Different sorting algorithms are optimal for different data types and sizes.

**Data Structures Used:**
- In-place arrays for quicksort (duration sorting)
- Additional arrays for merge sort (stable title sorting)

**Time and Space Complexity:**
- Merge Sort: O(n log n) time, O(n) space - guaranteed performance
- Quick Sort: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case, O(log n) space
- Both algorithms: O(n) for playlist reconstruction

**Sample Input & Output:**
```python
# Input
sorter.apply_sort_to_playlist(playlist, "duration", reverse=True)

# Output - Sorted by longest duration first
=== Demo Playlist (4 songs) ===
0. Hotel California by Eagles (6:31)
1. Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen (5:55)
2. Billie Jean by Michael Jackson (4:54)
3. Imagine by John Lennon (3:03)
```

**Code Snippet:**
```python
@staticmethod
def merge_sort_by_title(songs: List[SongNode], reverse: bool = False) -> List[SongNode]:
    if len(songs) <= 1:
        return songs
    mid = len(songs) // 2
    left = PlaylistSorter.merge_sort_by_title(songs[:mid], reverse)
    right = PlaylistSorter.merge_sort_by_title(songs[mid:], reverse)
    return PlaylistSorter._merge_by_title(left, right, reverse)
```

**Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them:**
- **Challenge:** Choosing appropriate algorithm for different data types
- **Solution:** Merge sort for strings (stable), quicksort for numbers (in-place)
- **Challenge:** Maintaining playlist structure after sorting
- **Solution:** Convert to array, sort, then rebuild linked list with original structure

# Input
skip_timer.start_song()  # Song starts playing
skip_timer.can_skip()    # Immediate skip attempt

# Output
Cannot skip yet. 27 seconds remaining.
```

**Code Snippet:**
```python
def can_skip(self) -> bool:
    if not self.current_song_start:
        return False
    elapsed = (datetime.now() - self.current_song_start).total_seconds()
    self.skip_enabled = elapsed >= self.skip_threshold
    return self.skip_enabled
```

**Challenges Faced & Resolution:**
- **Challenge:** Accurate timestamp tracking across system events

- Threshold-based duplicate detection (80% similarity)

**Sample Input & Output:**
```python
# Input
comparison = detector.suggest_merge(playlist1, playlist2)

# Output
Playlist similarity: 60.0%
Is duplicate? False (< 80% threshold)
Common songs: 3, Merge recommended? False
```

**Code Snippet:**
```python
def calculate_similarity(self, playlist1: Playlist, playlist2: Playlist) -> float:
    songs1 = self.get_playlist_songs_set(playlist1)
    songs2 = self.get_playlist_songs_set(playlist2)
    
    intersection = songs1 & songs2
    union = songs1 | songs2
    
    return len(intersection) / len(union) if union else 0.0
```

**Challenges Faced & Resolution:**
- **Challenge:** Handling edge cases (empty playlists, identical playlists)
- **Resolution:** Added comprehensive validation and special case handling
- **Challenge:** Determining appropriate similarity threshold
- **Resolution:** Research showed 80% threshold balances accuracy with usability

---
